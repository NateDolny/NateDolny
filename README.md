### Hey there

I am a computer science student inspired by the immersive worlds of science fiction, I have embarked on numerous projects fueled by imagination and a thirst for learning.  I am also deeply immersed in the GNU/Linux ecosystem, finding joy in its versatility and open-source ethos.  

I'm always eager to embrace new learning opportunities and collaborate on exciting projects. Lets connect and build something awesome together!
